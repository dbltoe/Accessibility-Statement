# Accessibility-Statement 1.0
This mod contains three versions of an Accessibility Statement that can be inserted into the Accessibility define_main_page for Accessibility for Zen Cart 1.5.8 and 2.0.0.

For 1.5.8, you will need the [Accessibility Page Mod](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2383){:target="_blank"} installed.

For 2.0.0, you will just need to go to Tools >> Define Pages Editor, select Plain Text for your editor and follow the instructions below.
## What's Included
### File Choices
This folder contains the following files.
- shortVersion.txt - The shortest version that explains your site's committment to accessibility.
- mediumVersion.txt - A slightly larger description of your site's committment to accessibility.
- longVersion.txt - A more detailed explanation of your site's committment to accessibility and your extra steps to meet that goal.
- README.md - This informational file.
- LICENSE - The license for free use.
## Instructions on Use
### Use Plain Text Editor ONLY
The .txt files contain PHP code that will automatically add your store's name to the output.  If you use any editor other than the plan text to insert the code, the PHP formatting will be **lost**.

Just open your define pages editor and make sure you are using plain text for the editor.

Copy and paste the complete text from the file you have chosen to use into the editor overwriting any code already there.

Click on Save.
## Accessibility Widget
Each of the above text files has a commented out portion with information about an accessibility widget.  A demo can be seen at the [Zen Cart Docs Page](https://docs.zen-cart.com/){:target="_blank"}.
If you choose **not** to use the widget, you do not need to modify the selected .txt file.
If you decide to use the widget, it is available at [ada4zencart.com](https://ada4zencart.com/index.php?main_page=index&referrer=C4ADA_11659651175){:target="_blank"}.  **NOTE:** Using this link will donate a portion of the purchase price to the Zen Cart team.  Once you have installed the widget's code on your site, you can remove the beginning HTML comment code (<!--) at the beginning of the widget paragraph and the closing comet code (-->) at the end of that group of paragraphs.
